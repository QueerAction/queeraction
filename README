the website will include:
- a constitution w/ google doc link
- image gallery
- historic timeline
- list of exec board members
- current semester meeting times (future) : event page

Website compiled by: Sage Cannady (February 2020) because VCU sux and so does Rams Connect. The staff are nice tho.... 
Anyways, this site will give us full atonymy and maybe we can get a consistent budget independent of OMSA to pay for a
URL.
